Cestrum nocturnum comes from subtropical areas, but adapts to other climates easily. However, it doesn't do very well in cold areas and it prefers semi-shadow, rather that full sun.

### Problems with the leaves

Last winter, some of the leaves (the newer ones) turned white:

![Cestrum nocturnum leaves are white due to low temperatures](./cestrum_nocturnum_white_leaves.png)

This is a result of cold drafts and low temperatures. 

Leaves are green due to the chlorophyll that the cells have. When they can't withstand the cold and die, only the [epidermis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf#Epidermis) remains. This skin has no color, hence we see it white. See a cross-section of a leaf [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf#/media/File:Bifacial_leaf_cross_section.jpg) to see the color-less skin and the green cells.
