> Kalanchoes are desert plants, mostly from Madagascar, although some are from southern Africa, with succulent stems and leaves. Theyâ€™re in the crassula family, so come by their succulence naturally. Many have smooth leaves, but some are quite hairy.

### Reproduction by cuttings

Leaves sprout new children and cuttings can take roots. To get the best result:

1. Let the leaves dry for a week (don't worry if it starts shrinking). This will prevent rotting. 
2. Place in not-very-moist soil (see picture [here](./kalanchoe_cutting_pots.png)).
