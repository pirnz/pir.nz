[Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalanchoe_beharensis)

> Kalanchoes are desert plants, mostly from Madagascar, although some are from southern Africa, with succulent stems and leaves. Theyâ€™re in the crassula family, so come by their succulence naturally. Many have smooth leaves, but some are quite hairy.
