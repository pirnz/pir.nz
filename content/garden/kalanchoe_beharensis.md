[Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalanchoe_beharensis)

> Kalanchoes are desert plants, mostly from Madagascar, although some are from southern Africa, with succulent stems and leaves. Theyâ€™re in the crassula family, so come by their succulence naturally. Many have smooth leaves, but some are quite hairy.

### Reproduction by cuttings

Leaves sprout new children. To avoid rotting, let the leaf dry for a week (don't worry if it starts shrinking). Then place in not-very-moist soil. For reference check [this picture](https://davesgarden.com/community/forums/fp.php?pid=9849936&extraimg=3#b).
