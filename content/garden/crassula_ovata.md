The plant shown in the picture is the cultivar _Monstruosa_. I have been cloning this plant since 2002.

### Reproduction by cuttings

You can cut a piece or take a single leaf. 

Leaves sprout new children and cuttings can take roots. To get the best result:

1. Let the leaves dry for a week (don't worry if it starts shrinking). This will prevent rotting. 
2. Place in not-very-moist soil.
