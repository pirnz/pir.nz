> The name is derived from the word “bifurcate” which means to fork or divide.

> Platycerium ferns are Epiphytes, like orchids, which means that they only grow **on** the host plant and not **from** the host plant like Parasites. Epiphytes generate their own food and are not dependent on the host plant for sustenance.
